# ledstripdynamics
A library for amazing light shows on LED-Strips

## Description
This project is currently in its early development stages and aims to develop a comprehensive library for creating light effects and animations on LED strips. The library will support customizable and combinable effects, enabling the creation of highly dynamic light shows. The initial phase of development focuses on simulating LED strip behavior, with subsequent support planned for WS2812B LED strips and other types of LED strips. The ultimate goal is to establish a foundational visual library that can be utilized in future projects, such as an AI-driven music visualizer.
